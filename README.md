ðŸŽµ Musical Instrument Review Analysis

ðŸ“– Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews of musical instruments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and visualization techniques. It extracts key insights like customer sentiment, commonly discussed topics, and review trends over time. The project is designed to be deployable as a full-stack application for real-time analytics.

ðŸš€ Features

1. Data Analysis
	â€¢	Data Cleaning: Preprocess review text by removing stopwords, non-alphabetic tokens, and punctuation.
	â€¢	Visualizations:
	â€¢	Histograms of review dates and ratings.
	â€¢	Word clouds for commonly used terms in reviews.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	â€¢	Tokenization and text normalization.
	â€¢	Extraction of noun phrases and their relationships using spaCy.
	â€¢	Parent-child relationships for noun phrases.
	â€¢	Topic modeling using Gensimâ€™s LDA to identify hidden topics in reviews.

3. Advanced Visualizations
	â€¢	Generate word clouds based on term frequencies.
	â€¢	Display the top 10 most frequent terms and noun phrases.
	â€¢	Enable interactive exploration of the dataset for real-time analysis.

4. Deployable Backend
	â€¢	REST API using Flask or Django with the following endpoints:
	â€¢	/upload: Upload review datasets.
	â€¢	/analyze: Perform analysis and return insights.
	â€¢	/visualize: Serve visualizations like histograms and word clouds.
