Musical Instrument Review Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews of musical instruments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and visualization techniques. It provides insights into customer sentiments, commonly discussed topics, and trends in reviews over time. The project is scalable and can be deployed as a full-stack application for real-time analysis.

Features

1. Data Analysis
	•	Data Cleaning: Processes review text by removing stopwords, non-alphabetic tokens, and punctuation.
	•	Data Visualization:
	•	Histograms for review dates and ratings.
	•	Word clouds showcasing frequently used terms.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	•	Tokenization and text normalization.
	•	Noun phrase extraction using spaCy.
	•	Parent-child relationships for noun phrases.
	•	Topic modeling using Gensim’s LDA.

3. Advanced Visualizations
	•	Dynamic word cloud visualizations based on term frequencies.
	•	Top 10 frequent terms and noun phrases in reviews.
	•	Interactive data exploration for deployment (future feature).

4. Deployable Backend
	•	REST API using Flask (or Django), allowing easy integration with any frontend.
	•	API routes for uploading data, extracting insights, and retrieving visualizations.

Installation

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8 or later
	•	pip (Python Package Manager)

Usage

Analyze the Dataset
	•	Load Musical_Instruments_5.json using the script.
	•	Automatically preprocess and clean the review text.
	•	Generate visualizations, including histograms and word clouds.

Extract Insights
	•	Identify most frequent terms and noun phrases.
	•	View topic modeling results for discovering hidden topics in reviews.

Deployment as Full-Stack Project

1. Backend
	•	Use Flask to serve API endpoints:
	•	/upload: Upload review datasets.
	•	/analyze: Perform analysis and return results.
	•	/visualize: Serve histograms, word clouds, and topic models.

2. Frontend
	•	Build a user-friendly interface with React or HTML/CSS.
	•	Integrate dynamic charts using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

3. Database
	•	Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store processed data.
	•	Add search functionality to retrieve review-specific analytics.

4. Deployment
	•	Use Docker to containerize the app for consistent deployment.
	•	Host the app on Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
	•	Enable SSL for secure communication.

Example Visualizations
	1.	Histogram of Ratings:

	2.	Word Cloud:

Future Enhancements
	•	Add sentiment analysis for detailed insights into positive and negative reviews.
	•	Implement real-time processing for streaming review data (e.g., Kafka).
	•	Provide user authentication for personalized insights.
